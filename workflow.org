* Store classfiles as shared_ptr, in order to facilitate sharing the
  structure.

* Do not modify the values inside the pointers; create new ones instead -
  purely functional mode.

* Even though we do not care about all instructions, we have to treat each of them, in case they take up more than one byte:
    * Some instructions (`lookupswitch` or `tableswitch`) have a variable length!

* Saving in-place or into directory.

* Cannot handle dynamic method invocation.

* Implement handling of interface methods.

* Implement sibling methods and transitive method invocations.

* Testing infrastructure!
